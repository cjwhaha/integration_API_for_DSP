## Q: how to judge which ad_type that request is

A: there are two ways to judge:

    1. excluding method

    The slot type is rewarded video as long as there has video object in request or is native as long as there has native object in request.

    If not, the slot type depends on the parameter instl that is in imp object. If the instl and IsSplashScreen are both true, the slot type is splash; if the instl is true and IsSplashScreen is false, th slot type is interstitial.

    if instl is false, the slot type is banner.

    2. judge ad_type according the value of parameter `BidRequest.Imp.Ext.ad_type`, 0:banner, 1:interstitial, 2:splash, 3:native, 4:rewarded video; 255:unknown.
